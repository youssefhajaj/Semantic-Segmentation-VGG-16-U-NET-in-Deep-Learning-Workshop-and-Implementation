# Semantic-Segmentation-VGG-16-U-NET-in-Deep-Learning-Workshop-and-Implementation
This project focuses on semantic segmentation, a crucial computer vision task where each pixel in an image is classified into specific categories. The notebook explores concepts, datasets, and implementations using TensorFlow and Python. It includes practical examples and visualizations to deepen understanding.

## Overview
This project is a hands-on workshop on semantic segmentation, a deep learning task that assigns a class label to every pixel in an image. Semantic segmentation is widely used in fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and satellite imagery analysis.

## Note ! : 
- i m using collab notebook on this project
- this is a link for extra documentation for better understanding please fell free to check it

## Key Topics
- Introduction to semantic segmentation.
- Understanding datasets for segmentation tasks (e.g., Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset).
- Building and training deep learning models using TensorFlow.
- Visualizing results and performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)
- Matplotlib

To install the required packages:
```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib
```

## Content
The notebook covers:
1. **Semantic Segmentation Overview**: Learn the basics of pixel-level classification.
2. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess datasets for segmentation.
3. **Model Implementation**: Build a U-Net or similar architecture for segmentation tasks.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Train the model and assess its performance using metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union).
5. **Visualization**: Display predictions alongside ground truth for validation.

## Usage
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/semantic-segmentation
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
