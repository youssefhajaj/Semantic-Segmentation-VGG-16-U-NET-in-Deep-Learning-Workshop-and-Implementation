# Semantic-Segmentation-VGG-16-U-NET-in-Deep-Learning-Workshop-and-Implementation
This project focuses on semantic segmentation, a crucial computer vision task where each pixel in an image is classified into specific categories. The notebook explores concepts, datasets, and implementations using TensorFlow and Python. It includes practical examples and visualizations to deepen understanding.
